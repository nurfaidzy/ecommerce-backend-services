# Ecommerce Backend Services

## üöÄ **ATLAS Implementation - Phase 1 Complete**

A professional **NestJS microservices** ecommerce backend with shared PostgreSQL database, demonstrating clean architecture principles and modern TypeScript development.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Core services implemented and ready for database connection

---

## üìã **Quick Start**

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your PostgreSQL credentials

# Build the project
npm run build

# üöÄ Start all services (EASIEST)
npm run all

# OR start just the API Gateway (if DB not configured)
npm run dev
```

> **Note**: The API Gateway can run without database config, but microservices need PostgreSQL credentials in `.env`

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

### Microservices Structure
```
/apps
  /ecommerce-backend-services  # API Gateway
  /category-service            # Category CRUD operations  
  /item-service               # Item/Product CRUD operations
/libs
  /common/entities           # Shared TypeORM entities
  /common/utils             # Slug generation utilities
  /dto                      # Validation DTOs
```

### Database Schema
- **Categories**: `id, name, slug, created_at, updated_at`
- **Items**: `id, name, slug, description, price, category_id, created_at, updated_at`
- **Relationships**: Category ‚Üí Items (One-to-Many)

---

## ÔøΩ **Quick Start Commands**

| Command | Description | What it runs |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `npm run all` | **üî• SIMPLEST** - Start everything | API Gateway + All Microservices |
| `npm run services` | Start only microservices | Category + Item services |
| `npm run dev` | Start just API Gateway | Main HTTP server only |

### Available Services After Running

- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:3000 *(Routes all requests to microservices)*
- **Category Service**: http://localhost:3001
- **Item Service**: http://localhost:3002

## ÔøΩüîß **API Endpoints**

### Categories Service
```http
GET    /categories              # List all categories

GET    /categories/:id          # Get category by ID  
GET    /categories/slug/:slug   # Get category by slug
PATCH  /categories/:id          # Update category
DELETE /categories/:id          # Delete category
```

### Items Service
```http
GET    /items                     # List all items
POST   /items                     # Create new item
GET    /items/:id                 # Get item by ID
GET    /items/slug/:slug          # Get item by slug  
GET    /items/category/:categoryId # Get items by category
PATCH  /items/:id                 # Update item
DELETE /items/:id                 # Delete item
```
